\section{Introduction}

The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (hereafter BOSS, CITE???) is a
wide-field redshift survey designed to measure the expansion rate of the
Universe using the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) method. On completion, BOSS
will have measured redshifts to 1.5 million galaxies and 160,000 quasars over
10,000 deg$^2$. This will allow a 1\% distance measurement using the BAO method
at z=0.35 and z=0.6 from the galaxy sample, as well as a 1.5\% distance
measurement at z=2.5 using the quasar sample. BOSS started taking spectroscopic 
data in September 2009, and is scheduled to complete in 2014. The first
spectroscopic data release from BOSS (DR9) is scheduled for July 2012; the first
cosmological results (CITES here????) were submitted in April 2012.
This paper sets out to document the algorithms used to select the BOSS galaxy
sample and describe its use as well as to describe the basic properties of the
galaxy sample.

There are three properties that determine the performance of a galaxy sample for
BAO measurements - the number density of the sample, the volume it covers, and
its large-scale clustering amplitude. These are usefully combined into the
effective volume of the sample (??? EFFECTIVE VOLUME EQN ????). Increasing the
effective volume of the sample directly increases the cosmological constraining
power of the sample. The requirements on the BOSS galaxy sample were to obtain
a sample of objects with a constant number density of $3 \times 10^{-4} h^{3}
\rm{Mpc}^{-3}$ out to z=0.6 (CHECK THIS EXACT CUT OFF????), falling off with a
magnitude limit at higher redshifts. 

Using the most luminous and most massive galaxies is an
efficient way to select samples optimized to be cosmological tracers. These
galaxies can be selected with low contamination rates from multiband imaging
data, and their redshifts may be obtained relatively efficiently. This is 
not a new observation; the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Luminous Red Galaxy
(LRG) sample (CITE???) and the 2SLAQ (2dF-SDSS LRG and Quasar, CITES???) used 
exactly such criteria to select samples of objects. BOSS extends these samples
in one important direction : while the SDSS LRG and 2SLAQ samples explicitly
targeted red galaxies, BOSS attempts to select a complete sample of massive
galaxies {\it irrespective} of their color. 

This paper is organized as follows FINISH THIS????

\section{The Sample Selection}

\subsection{Imaging Data}



\subsection{Color Definitions}

In order to succintly describe the galaxy target selection, it is convenient to
define a set of auxiliary colors that track the locus of a passively evolving
population of galaxies in $gri$ color space. Following CITE Eisenstein et al???
and Cannon et al???? CITE, we define 
\begin{eqnarray}
\cll & = &  0.7 (\gmod - \rmod) + 1.2(\rmod - \imod - 0.18)  \\
\cpp & = & (\rmod - \imod) - (\gmod - \rmod)/4.0 - 0.18 
\end{eqnarray}
to describe the low redshift locus and 
\begin{eqnarray}
\dpp & = & (\rmod - \imod) - (\gmod - \rmod)/8 \,,
\end{eqnarray}
to describe the high redshift locus. As discussed above, the colors are defined
using SDSS model magnitudes, and are extinction-corrected. As was discussed in
Eis et al CITE??, the two sets of colors are necessary to describe the color
locus first when the 4000\AA\ break is in the SDSS $g$ band and then when it
redshifts into the $r$ band at $z\sim0.4$. This naturally divides target
selection into low and high redshift samples divided approximately at
$z\sim0.4$. 

Figure ???? plots these colors compared with both the stellar locus,
as well as a population of passively evolving galaxies. We see that $\cll$ runs
parallel to the low redshift galaxy locus, while $\cpp$ is approximately
perpendicular to it. The high redshift locus is described by $\dpp$ which runs
parallel to it.

The low redshift (denoted LOWZ) sample 

\subsection{The CMASS sample}


\subsection{Summary of Target Selection}

We summarize the two target selection algorithms here. The LOWZ targets are
defined by 
\begin{eqnarray}
\rcmod  & < & 13.5 + \cll/0.3 \\ 
|\cpp| & < & 0.2 \\
16 & < & 19.6 \\
\rpsf - \rcmod & > & 0.3 \,\,,
\end{eqnarray}
while the CMASS objects are selected by 
\begin{eqnarray}
\icmod & < & 19.86 + 1.6(\dpp - 0.8) \\
17.5 & < \icmod <  & 19.9 \\
\dpp & > & 0.55 \\
\ipsf - \imod & > & 0.2 + 0.2(20 - \imod) \\
\zpsf - \zmod & > & 9.125 - 0.46 \zmod \\
\rmod - \imod & < & 2 \\
\ifib & < & 21.5 \,\,.
\end{eqnarray}
